# Build and Link LoMRF

In order to build LoMRF from source, you need to have Java SE Development Kit (e.g., OpenJDK) version 8 or higher and 
[SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (v0.13.x) installed in your system. Furthermore, LoMRF build depends on the [auxlib](https://github.com/anskarl/auxlib), [Optimus](https://github.com/vagm/Optimus) and optionally to [
Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) and [LPSolve](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net).

## Instructions to build LoMRF from source

**Step 1.** Clone and publish locally the auxlib project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/anskarl/auxlib.git
$ cd auxlib
$ sbt ++2.11.8 publishLocal
```

**Step 2.** Clone and publish locally the Optimus project (see instructions [here](https://github.com/vagm/Optimus)).

**Step 3 (optional).** Please note that Gurobi is required for running max-margin weight learning and optionally can also 
be used for MAP inference. In order to enable support for Gurobi, you have to build Optimus with Gurobi support 
([see instructions](https://github.com/vagm/Optimus)) and then include Gurobi library dependencies to the `./lib` subdirectory 
inside the cloned LoMRF directory (create if not already exists), as it is illustrated in the tree below:

```bash
LoMRF
|--lib
    |-- gurobi.jar
```

**Step 4.** To build the LoMRF distribution, give the following command:

```bash
$ sbt dist
```

After a successful compilation, the LoMRF distribution is located inside the `./target/universal/lomrf-<version>.zip`
file. You can extract this file and add the `path/to/lomrf-<version>/bin` in your PATH, in order to execute the LoMRF
scripts from terminal (see Section [Add LoMRF executables in your default PATH](#Add-LoMRF-executables-in-your-default-PATH)). 
The distribution contains all library dependencies and requires Java 8
(or higher runtime). Sources, documentation and the compiled library (without dependencies) are archived as jar files
into the `./target/scala-2.11/` directory. The resulting documentation is located inside the `./target/site/scaladocs`
directory.

**Optional step 5.** Run Unit tests.
In order to run Unit tests, you need to download example data. Please follow the instructions in 
[Download Example and Unit Testing Data](6_2_download_example_data.md). LoMRF uses the [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org) 
framework for unit testing.

To run all tests (**requires LPSolve and Gurobi solvers installed**), give the following command inside the SBT console:
```
test
```

If you want to run a specific test, e.g., `lomrf.mln.inference.MaxWalkSATSpecTest`:
```
testOnly lomrf.mln.inference.MaxWalkSATSpecTest
```



## Only for Microsoft Windows XP users

LoMRF depends on the JANSI library, in order to print colored log messages in the console. JANSI depends on a JNI library
that is available from "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable". You can get a free copy from Microsoft at the
following link: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=5582

## Add LoMRF executables in your default PATH

You can add all CLI tools to your default PATH, in order to directly call LoMRF tools from anywhere in the command line
interface. Depending on your OS configuration you have the add and export the path `/path/to/lomrf-<version>/bin` to
the `PATH` variable.

For example, lets say that the LoMRF distribution version 0.5.1 is being installed in your home directory in `$HOME/lomrf-0.5.1`,
the directory structure inside the LoMRF directory is the following:

```bash
lomrf-0.5.1/
|-- bin
|-- etc
|-- lib
```

### Linux, Unix and MacOS X

The `bin` sub-directory contains all LoMRF executable tools. In order to add this sub-directory in your default `PATH`
add the following line in you profile file.


**BASH** e.g., inside `.profile`, `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file in your home directory:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/lomrf-0.5.1/bin
```

**CSH/TCSH** e.g., inside `~/.login` file in your home directory:
```csh
set path = ($path $HOME/lomrf-0.5.1/bin .)
```
or in `~/.cshrc` file in your home directory:
```csh
setenv PATH $PATH:$HOME/lomrf-0.5.1/bin:.
```

### Microsoft Windows Operating Systems

For MS Windows OS add the location of LoMRF sub-folder (e.g., `C:\path\to\lomrf-0.5.1\bin`) in your PATH environment variable.

## Gurobi installation instructions (optional)
Please follow the installation instructions from the [Gurobi website](http://www.gurobi.com).


## Using LoMRF as a library

Follow the first 2 steps of Section [Instructions to build LoMRF from source](#instructions-to build-lomrf-from-source) and then publish locally the LoMRF:

```bash
$ sbt publishLocal
```

Thereafter, in order to link LoMRF (e.g., version 0.5.1) to your [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) project, add the
following dependency:

```
libraryDependencies += "com.github.anskarl" %% "lomrf" % "0.5.1"
```

Similarly, in an [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) pom file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.anskarl</groupId>
    <artifactId>lomrf_2.11</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.1</version>
</dependency>
```
